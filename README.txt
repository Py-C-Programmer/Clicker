The program 'key_press_detect' allows you to make full records of your keyboard and mouse usage (key-logging) and after that save and play these records as
fast and frequently as you need.

You also have an opportunity to make some changes in your records. And you have 'clicks_position' in order to define coordinates of mouse clicks and be able
to add cursor shifts into the record.
